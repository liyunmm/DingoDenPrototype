          <p> Overall, my experience as a volunteer for the charity was a rewarding one. It was not only beneficial for my personal development in terms of honing in on my communication and people skills, but it was also a fantastic opportunity for me to expand my connections with different people and make new friends. An added bonus in this experience was getting to play a small yet significant role in a charity that focuses on an area that is not often discussed in society and which I am highly passionate about. - <i><b>Annie, Volunteering since 2016</b></i></p>

          <p> My volunteering experience for the charity was an overall positive and educating one. I believe it was rewarding largely in part because I got to play a role in conserving the fauna of Australia’s unique ecosystem by raising awareness to the Australian public about the state of the dingoes species. - <i><b>Alex, Volunteering since 2018</b></i></p>
